**So Melody, How was your week?**
So we learned about passing values by reference. You know pointers and all that jazz, and I can't really quite get it. Project 2 is out, and I have been working on that with my partner
which is so much better that docker isn't a requirement. We are practicing a bit more on the C++ language and have utlized our "first" C++ map. The project also makes us
practice on reading in txt files and caching them with data. We also have our test coming up in two weeks so let's see how that goes. Personal life wise, I have started bulking
which is 250 more calories which has been going well!

**What is in the way?**
There are some bumps in the road in regards to reading in files in C++, but I think we got that down. Career fair is also coming up so I have been sort of preparing for that,
however, these days it's hard to find motivation to do anything. I just can't wait until this is over.

**Sooo Melody, got any plans for the week?**
This week: Carreer fair and trying to find an internship. Keep practicing, study for the test, and get that project turned in.

**WOW WOW MELODY'S PICK OF THE WEEK**

Download this game called Marple in the ios app. It was introduced to me, and if you like sodoku type games that require you to use process of elimination this one was quite fun
even though it took me like 30 mins to get through a tutorial.

Thanks for reading this! Melody OUT!
