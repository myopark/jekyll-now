title: Week One in the Highly Recommended Downing Class
---

**So Melody, How was your week?**
So it was pretty stressful with the project coming on, but I think I did it correctly. Now it's just the anxiety that I won't get docked off of stupid things like forgetting to put in my
SHA or something. In class, we learned the difference between passing by reference and by value which I still don't quite grasp yet which is okay! This weekend I went to NYC again, and it was
very nice to come back to the city that finally won my heart. I work for Major League Hacking as a coach, so I had to go there for training at Swift's apartment in Brooklyn. It was pretty sweet. I had
to leave my 11 year old chihuahua with a friend this weekend and poor thing was so depressed that I was gone.

**What is in the way?**
So with future projects, I hope that environment set up won't be as bad. My concern is that I won't be able to find a partner that will work with me and my schedule.
I am also scared that I would not be able to contribute due to my timid personality when it comes to problem solving, but that is something I just have to get over
and do my best in each project.

**Sooo Melody, got any plans for the week?**
Honestly, same old same old. Continue learning more about C++ and software engineering and study references and values. 

**WOW WOW MELODY'S PICK OF THE WEEK**
So something interesting I learned, Major League Hacking's official gaming sponsor is now [Watch Dogs 2](https://watchdogs.ubisoft.com/watchdogs/en-us/home/). I didn't realize Ubisoft was coming out with a second one
since the first Watch Dogs had negative reviews on it. I'm excited to see what the game dev team have done to make improvements in the game play.If you go to an MLH member event, you have a chance to win
a copy of the game at our mini events and contests. Also you can get a discount code to purchase the game.

Thanks for reading this! Melody OUT!
