**What's new with you?**

Absolutely nothing. Project 1 came out, and I swear to god I am spending more time to set up the environment and understanding the criteria. Which, I guess,
is the goal of this to make us good software enginneers.I am also extremely lucky that I got anything to work on my "danky" laptop. I can't take it
to campus because the wifi doesn't work with it for some reason, so it's hard to get help in person. I also got my dog this weekend so that's something exciting. 

**What's in your way?**
DOCKER. I am so confused, but I will figure it out. I'm getting a test error, and am not sure why. I also need to figure out how to do the public tests.

**What will you do next week?**
I'm going to New York for Major League Hacking this weekend, and keep preparing for interviews. 


**Something cool this week**

Fitbit released a new charge HR as well as a cool water proof band. The release of these two bands alongside with their new app interface is making them one of the
leading fitness products. Also be looking for the iPhone 7 release date.
